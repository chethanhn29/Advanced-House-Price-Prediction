# Advanced-House-Price-Prediction
It is a Advanced Problem of Regression which requires advanced techniques of feature engineering, feature selection and extraction, modelling, model evaluation, and Statistics.
# ABSTRACT 
House prices increase every year, so there is a need for a system to predict house prices. Usually, House price index represents the summarized price changes of residential housing. While for a single-family house price prediction, it needs more accurate method based on location, house type, size, year of build, local amenities, and other factors which could affect house demand and supply. With limited dataset and data features, a practical and composite data pre-processing, creativefeature engineering method is examined.

House price prediction can also help the developer determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a
house. It needs more accurate method based on location, house type, size, build year, local amenities, and some other factors which could affect house
demand and supply. This model uses regression techniques to predict the price of the house. In this project we train a model based on the given
data to predict the house price as accurate as possible. So that it predicts the house price for customers with respect to their budgets and priorities by analyzing previous market trends and price ranges.




# Description


Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Practice Skills
Creative feature engineering 
Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
Acknowledgments
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. 

# Objective
The Objective is to use Machine Learning to Build a model to Predict House  Price  Using Advanced Regression Techniques, With analysis of given quantitative measurements of House.

# Problem Statement
People looking to buy a new house tend to be more conservative with their budgets and market strategies. House price prediction can help the customer to
arrange the right time to purchase a house.
Nowadays, everything is shifting from manual to automated systems. So, we decided to develop a model that predicts the price of the house when user
provides location and size as input.
# CONCLUSION
In this project we used regression algorithms to predict house prices of real dataset of Seattle, USA. This dataset is used to train and test four different
regression models which include Linear Regression, Decision tree Regressor, Random Forest regressor and Xtreme Gradient Boosying.

In order to evaluate performance of each model we have used evaluation metrics like R-squared value and adjusted R-squared value. The value of R2 and
Adjusted R2 are compared to select accurate model.


By making a clear analysis we have found that linear regression and Xtreme Gradient Boosting has high R squared and Adjusted R squared values and Decsion tree  has lower values.
Hence, we considered Linear Regression model to predict the house prices. So, we can conclude that system makes optimal use of linear regression to predict house prices. 

The application developed provides a user interface which allows the user to Register, Login, and Logout and enter features of the
house as input based on his/her requirements. Based on the inputs provided by the user accurate house price is predicted by the model and displayed on the
Interface. Thus, the system developed helps to fulfil user providing accurate price and reducing risk of huge investment.
